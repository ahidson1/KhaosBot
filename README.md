# KhaosBot
Work in progress. A discord bot with basic functions, greeting, randomized raffle, and a basic token system
to make this work, you will need to go to https://discordapp.com/ 
go to developers => developer portal
create a new application and set it up to your preferences for your server. 
Then create a new bot user and copy its key to the token.txt file in the Data Folder.
Once this is done invite the bot to your server and while the project runs, or after it's published it will operate on your server.
